## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

2. Enter "mcp-agentapi" as the repository name
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Choose whether to make it public or private
5. Click "Create repository"
6. **Do not** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license

## 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

### Option 1: Using the provided script

Run the provided script:

```bash
./push-to-github.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual setup

If the script doesn't work, you can manually push your repository:

```bash
# Set up the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/lord-dubious/mcp-agentapi.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Create a repository on GitHub
gh repo create lord-dubious/mcp-agentapi --public --source=. --push
```

## 3. Verify the Repository

After pushing, verify that your repository is available on GitHub:

https://github.com/lord-dubious/mcp-agentapi

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you're having trouble authenticating with GitHub, you may need to use a personal access token instead of your password:

1. Go to [GitHub's token settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name and select the "repo" scope
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Use the token as your password when pushing to GitHub

### Other Issues

If you're still having trouble, please refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).
